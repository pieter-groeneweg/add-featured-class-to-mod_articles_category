adding a class "featured"

In forum topic https://forum.joomla.org/viewtopic.php?f=708&t=977304 member GillianBBP asked how to add a class "featured" to an override.

Let's do it!

Copy this code to your templates/your_template/html/mod_articles_category folder..

I named it alternative.php to have it available both ways...

After saving it, you can add style .featured to your css file(s)
